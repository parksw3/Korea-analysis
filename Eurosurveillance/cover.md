Dear Editors:
  
We are submitting our manuscript, “Potential roles of social distancing in mitigating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea”, for consideration for publication in Eurosurveillance. This material has not previously been published elsewhere.

Understanding the South Korean experience with COVID-19 is valuable because it provides evidence that epidemics can be suppressed with less extreme measures than those taken by China. Its recent success in suppressing the spread has been widely attributed to its intense contact tracing efforts. Here, we report on possible roles of social distancing in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 by comparing outbreaks from two major cities in South Korea with available traffic data. We present the first analysis of the power of social distancing in a unique context and propose that the paper thus merits rapid dissemination.

Sincerely,

Sang Woo Park
